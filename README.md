# Extended essay
This is the repository for my Extended Essay that I wrote as part of my IB (International Baccalaureate) Diploma program education. The title of the document is "What is the most appropriate random number algorithm for procedural generation in game development". See the "Document" file for the essay itself, and the "data" file for the data generated by the tests.

## Abstract
This essay discusses the requirements of a random number algorithm/generator for use in procedural content generation, specifically within the field of video game development, and how the limitations of modern computers impact the feasibility of each algorithm. The individual technical details, flaws and merits of four random number algorithms are explored and are then compared through the use of various statistical tests, in order to determine their suitability. Based on the merits of each algorithm and the analysis of the results produced, the conclusion drawn was that the Mersenne twister algorithm proved to the most appropriate for use in procedural generation, however the Fibonacci LFSR provides a substitute where time is of the essence and a smaller period is acceptable.
